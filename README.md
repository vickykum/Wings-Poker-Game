# Wings-Poker-Game
Poker Game that is comprised with new ML features and Texas Hold-em rules
Developed by a team of 4 people: Rupali, Naibing, Adam, and Vickykumar. Students in Software Engineering course trying to develop a game where a player can create an account and login to play whenever required. All the money won or loose will be stored in the database. Difference from other game is that here we track the player's wins and loose based on the decision made by them in previous hand. This way using probablity of hands and type of action we could hint them how to not make a bad step.

-Its a fun game where everyone can enjoy gaming if not interested in winning.
